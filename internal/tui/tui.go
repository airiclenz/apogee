// SkillCatalog is the read-only view of the discovered skills the TUI needs: the full sorted
// list for the /skill picker (List) and a by-id lookup for an attached chip's label (Get). It
// is satisfied by *skills.Catalog; the TUI depends only on this interface so it stays
// unit-testable with a fake, and — being an interface — it is a reference header safe to hold
// in the value-copied Model (ADR 0011). A nil catalog means no skills are wired; every reader
// guards for it.

// The engine seam (phase-2 detail plan §3 C5)

// Engine is the narrow, local view of the agent the TUI drives. It is satisfied by
// *agent.Agent (= *apogee.Agent), but the TUI depends only on this interface so it
// never imports the root module path (the ADR-0010 invariant) and stays unit-testable
// with a fake engine. The worker goroutine is the only caller of the Exchange-driving
// methods (Submit/Step); ClearContext/Compact are driven from the Update goroutine but
// only at idle, when no worker runs — so the single-driver contract holds (phase-2 detail
// plan §3 C1).
type Engine interface {
	// Submit enqueues user input to begin or continue an Exchange.

	// Step advances the loop one Turn and returns at a quiescent boundary.
	Step(context.Context) (domain.StepResult, error)
	// Snapshot captures the serializable conversation state at a boundary.
	Snapshot() (domain.Session, error)
	// ClearContext drops the model's conversation history (the /clear command); the
	// host's visible transcript is unaffected. Called only at idle (no worker running).
	ClearContext() error
	// AbortExchange discards an Exchange the user cancelled, returning the engine to a clean
	// boundary the next Submit/ClearContext accepts. Called once the worker has returned its
	// cancelledMsg (no worker owns the engine), so the post-Esc /clear or message is not
	// rejected with ErrInputPending.
	AbortExchange()
	// Compact triggers generative Compaction on demand (the /compact command): it summarizes
	// the conversation and replaces the folded history with the summary. A real upstream call,
	// so the TUI drives it on a worker goroutine. Called only at idle. skipped is true when the
	// conversation was too small to fold (no call made, history untouched) so the UI reports
	// "nothing to compact" and leaves the gauge alone; it is always false on error.
	Compact(context.Context) (skipped bool, err error)
	// SetMode changes the Agent's autonomy mode (Shift+Tab cycling). It is goroutine-safe, so
	// the UI may call it while the worker drives a Step; the change takes effect on the next
	// tool call.

	// SetConfineToWorkspace changes Auto's blast radius (the /confine off|on command): true —
	// the default — fences confinable subprocess writes to the workspace and gates through
	// Approval what cannot be fenced, while false is the user's explicit "I am the sandbox" and
	// runs every call unconfined with their full privileges (ADR 0012). Like SetMode it is
	// goroutine-safe, so the UI may call it while the worker drives a Step; the change takes
	// effect on the next tool call and affects only this Session — persisting the host
	// acknowledgement is the binary's job, not the engine's.
	SetConfineToWorkspace(bool)
	// ConfineToWorkspace reports the blast radius the NEXT tool call's Resolution will read —
	// the live setting, so it already reflects any earlier SetConfineToWorkspace. The /confine
	// status report renders it, and /confine off|on reads it to say whether the line changed
	// anything. Goroutine-safe like SetMode, though the UI calls it only at idle.

	// ContextWindow is the active model's context-window size in tokens (0 when unknown), as
	// reported by upstream discovery. The footer renders it statically (e.g. "32k") and it is the
	// denominator of the live status-line context-fill gauge, which lights as each top-level
	// UsageEvent folds the turn's total-token count into ctxUsed (0 leaves the gauge hidden).
	ContextWindow int

	// HostAlias is a short, friendly name for the upstream host shown in the footer (a
	// `host-alias` config key). Empty falls back to the endpoint URL's host at render time.
	HostAlias string

	// Version is the resolved build version (internal/version.String()), the single value the
	// binary resolves and the TUI displays — the /version command and the start-up box both
	// read it from here so the TUI never imports the version package. Empty ⇒ unwired.
	Version string

	// Confinement is the host's confinement situation as the composition root resolved it, for
	// the /confine status report to name. The TUI never derives it — internal/platform is the
	// binary's dependency, not the renderer's — so an unwired zero value simply reports
	// "unknown" rather than inventing a backend.
	Confinement ConfinementInfo

	// SaveHostAcknowledgement persists THIS host's `unconfined-hosts:` acknowledgement to the
	// global config (the `/confine off --save` half) and returns the file it wrote, so the
	// confirmation can name what changed and how to undo it. nil ⇒ persistence is unavailable
	// and `--save` says so; the session toggle itself never depends on it. Writing config is
	// the binary's job (it owns the path and the file format), exactly like Save below.
	SaveHostAcknowledgement func() (path string, err error)

	// Skills is the discovered skill catalog the /skill picker lists and the attached chips
	// label; nil ⇒ no skills are wired (the picker offers nothing, chips fall back to the raw
	// ID). The binary backs it with a live skills.Provider and the agent loop resolves the SAME
	// provider through Config.Skills, so the body the model sees matches what the picker showed —
	// including skills ReloadSkills swapped in mid-session.
	Skills SkillCatalog

	// ReloadSkills re-scans the skill source dirs and swaps in a fresh catalog, so a skill added
	// or edited after launch is picked up the next time the /skill picker opens. nil disables the
	// refresh (the catalog stays as loaded at launch). The binary wires it to the shared
	// skills.Provider both this picker (Skills) and the agent loop (Config.Skills) read, so a
	// refreshed skill both shows in the picker AND resolves when attached. The picker edge-
	// triggers it on open, not per keystroke; every caller guards for nil.
	ReloadSkills func()

	// Save persists a snapshot of the conversation; nil disables session saving. The
	// binary supplies a store-backed saver (it owns the path and on-disk format — phase-2
	// detail plan §3 C5). The model calls it only at a quiescent boundary (a clean quit),
	// passing the snapshot it took itself, so the file I/O stays out of the renderer while
	// the "is it safe to snapshot" decision stays with the model that owns the Engine.

// matched against (ADR 0012, amendment 2026-07-21). It is the diagnostic half of /confine —
// the *effective* setting is read live off the [Engine], not from here, because the user can
// change it mid-session. The zero value means "the binary wired nothing"; the report says
// unknown rather than guessing.

// the Bubble Tea program, then binds the program to br (br.Bind) *before* program.Run()
// starts the loop — so the late-bound event and approval delegates reach the live program
// the moment the first worker emits (phase-2 detail plan §3 C2/C3; ADR 0011). The program
// context is ctx, so a program-wide shutdown also cancels an in-flight Exchange (C4).
