# TODO — parked ideas (not in Phase 3 / not in `v1.0.0`)

Ideas worth doing later, deliberately deferred so they don't bloat the v1 freeze.
Each entry records *enough* design that we don't re-derive it when we pick it up.

## Configurable tool × mode security matrix

**Status:** parked 2026-06-24 (Phase-3 grill). Post-v1, **additive** — config is additive,
so this is a minor bump, not a freeze break.

**The idea (owner, 2026-06-24):** let the user configure precisely how each tool behaves in
each mode — a `(tool × mode) → disposition` matrix surfaced in config.

**Why it's coherent:** the disposition table *already exists internally* — `needsApproval` /
D5 is exactly `(mode × tool-disposition) → {auto-run, confine, gate, deny}`. v1 ships it as an
explicit internal table; this feature would expose a *user-tunable* layer on top.

**The two constraints that make it safe + shippable (must hold when we build it):**

1. **Tighten-only (the law).** A user override may only make a cell **stricter** than its mode
   default (toward gate/deny) — **never looser**. Loosening a whole tool-class would silently
   dissolve a mode's guarantee (e.g. `terminal → Auto → allow, unconfined` reintroduces the
   "unsupervised *and* unbounded" hole ADR 0004/0012 forbid; `write_file → Plan → allow` breaks
   Plan's read-only promise). The **only** blanket loosen is `confine-to-workspace=false`, which
   is gated behind an explicit "I am the sandbox" acknowledgement. Narrow, explicit, opt-in
   loosens (a `NetworkAllow` host; a `terminal` command-pattern allowlist entry like `go build`,
   `npm test`) are fine — same shape as the per-project allowlist already in `ConfinementBox`.

2. **Freeze cost.** A per-tool×mode config block turns **every tool name into a frozen config
   key** and adds a sizable schema right at the `v1.0.0` cut (fights D7 — keep the v1 surface
   minimal). Deferring it past v1 avoids that; config additivity means it loses nothing by waiting.

**Related "approval-precision" knobs to design *together* with this (also parked):**
- **Command-pattern allowlist for `terminal`** — "auto-allow `go build` / `npm test`" without a
  prompt. This is the thing people usually *actually* want when they say "configure the tools";
  finer than tool-level. A narrow explicit loosen (constraint 1), so it's allowed.
- **Per-host `NetworkAllow` precision** — already a field on `ConfinementBox`; a UI/config layer
  to manage it per project belongs with the matrix.

**What v1 ships instead (so the deferral is safe):** the internal disposition table (D5) +
the `confine-to-workspace` flag (the one blanket loosen) + the existing narrow allowlists.
